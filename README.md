# 🧠 TALENTGRAPH

**TALENTGRAPH** is an AI-powered recruitment analytics platform designed to make hiring fair, efficient, and data-driven.  
It leverages NLP, graph-based modeling, and multimodal AI to analyze resumes, match candidates to roles, and assess interview performance — all through intelligent data visualization and analytics.

---

## 🚩 Overview

Traditional hiring processes are often slow, biased, and disconnected.  
TALENTGRAPH transforms recruitment using **data integration** and **AI models** to create a complete view of candidate skills, job requirements, and behavioral indicators.

## 🔍 Business Objectives

1. **Resume Intelligence** — Extract key skills, education, and experiences from resumes.
2. **Job–Candidate Matching** — Build semantic search models to align resumes with job roles.
3. **Interview Analytics** — Use multimodal AI (text, audio, video) to assess stress, sentiment, and engagement.
4. **Skill Graph Visualization** — Map skill relationships for workforce planning and hiring strategy.
5. **Fair & Transparent Hiring** — Detect anomalies and bias to support equitable recruitment.
